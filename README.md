# Neuron Network Simulation

**This project simulates a simplified version of a humans neural network. To test this project run these commands in the terminal:**  

  javac NeuronNetwork.java

  java NeuronNetwork f

  java Neuron Network g 

*Files 'f' and 'g' are files need to execute a simulation, they contain the formatted data needed*
